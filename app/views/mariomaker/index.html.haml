  Current, I am hosting a contest!  Whoever reaches 50 board plays first wins a game of their choice!
%br
  It will be shipped via amazon to their address, or bought on Steam and gifted!
%br
  Contest rules are simple.  First to reach 50 stage rates and has at least 25 ratings given wins!
%p
  I will alert the winner through their provided e-mail when they win!

%p
  I created this site so that we can share levels in an easier fashion, and rate levels based on 3 main attributes.

%p
  %b Fun:
  Is the level fun?!  Pretty simple.

%p
  %b Puzzle:
  Is your level a totally thought-provoking?  Does it require some trial and error, or is the player going to have to worry about running up the 500 second timer?

%p
  %b Difficulty:
  This is for those levels that you just KNOW are going to cost you some lives. Lots of enemies, or just a devilishly laid out stage!

  I built this site on top of another site I am working on,
  =link_to "Cliq", cliq_path(1)
%p
  I didn't want to recreate a whole site when I could use the account set up I made for the other site! So, try and enjoy both! I will be transferring it to a new domain shortly.
